Picket: Not in my backyard!
===========================

[ ![Codeship Status for ryanfaerman/picket](https://codeship.com/projects/6d7f1380-a4d1-0132-15d6-0e814c8fc580/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/66504)

Picket is a lightweight, network-level, advertising blocker. It serves both DNS and HTTP/S traffic, redirecting any domain found on a blacklist to itself. Each advertising request is given a valid (although empty) response - images are empty, etc.

Ideal for running on any host on the network or on something like a Raspberry Pi.
