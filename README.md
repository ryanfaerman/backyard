Backyard: A network-level (b)ad blocker
=======================================

Backyard is a lightweight, network-level, advertising blocker. It serves both DNS and HTTP/S traffic, redirecting any domain found on a blacklist to itself. Each advertising request is given a valid (although empty) response - images are empty, etc.

Ideal for running on any host on the network or on something like a Raspberry Pi.
